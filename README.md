# Real-Time Threat Detection System
# 📜 Overview

This project focuses on Real-Time Threat Detection using Video Surveillance, designed to detect threats such as violence, presence of weapons, or abnormal behaviors in public spaces. It leverages deep learning-based video classification models for accurate behavior analysis. The system can process CCTV footage and raise alarms when suspicious activities are detected, thereby improving public safety and proactive threat response.

# 💡 Key Features
🎥 Video Upload & Real-Time Processing: Upload and analyze videos for detecting potential threats.

🧠 Deep Learning-based Classification: Utilizes CNN + GRU-based architecture for action and behavior recognition.

⚙️ Multi-Fusion Strategy: Early, Mid, and Late Fusion techniques to combine spatial and temporal features efficiently.

📊 User Interface (Gradio): An intuitive web interface for easy video upload, analysis, and visualization of detection results.

🚨 Alert & Flag Mechanism: Instant flagging of suspicious content for further review.
